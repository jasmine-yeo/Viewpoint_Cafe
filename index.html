			<h1>Landguard Visitor Centre, View Point Cafe and Ferry</h1>
		</div>

		<h3>Eat, drink and enjoy the view</h3>
			<p>Located between Landguard Fort and the Port of Felixstowe is the John Bradfield Viewing Area - voted one of the top 50 things to do in Suffolk.</p>

			<p>From here you can enjoy stunning views across the estuary to the Shotley Peninsula and the towns of Harwich and Dovercourt (both in Essex). If the weather is really clear you can even see the off-shore wind turbines beyond The Naze.</p>

			<p>Though the scenery is beautiful it is not what most visitors are here to see, they come to watch the hustle and bustle of the Port of Felixstowe and the vast container ships that come into the harbour following the natural deep water channel to berth up at the docks.</p>

		<h3>Landguard Visitor Centre and View Point Cafe</h3>
			<p>The Landguard Visitor Centre and View Point Cafe is a warm and friendly building with fun hands-on displays, videos and exhibits on the attractions of the Peninsula, public toilets and a 60 seater cafe (with both indoor and outdoor seating) serving all day breakfasts, snacks, fresh fish and chips, salads, cakes, ice cream, teas and coffees. The centre is open daily 0900-1600. Closed Christmas Day.</p>
